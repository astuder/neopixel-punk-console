The goal of this project is to display colorful patterns on a strip of WS2812 or SK6812 RGB LEDs (aka NeoPixels) without the help of an MCU.

This repository contains the design files for the hardware.
* [punk-console-main](punk-console-main): RGB LED driver circuit
* [punk-console-oscillator](punk-console-oscillator): Pattern generator circuit

Both folders contain a PDF of the schematic and the EDA project created with [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) version 6.0.

A detailed discussion of the design is published [here](https://hackaday.io/project/183093-neopixel-punk-console).
