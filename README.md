This repository contains the design files for the hardware.
* [punk-console-main](neopixel-punk-main): RGB LED driver circuit
* [punk-console-oscillator](neopixel-punk-oscillator): Pattern generator circuit

Both folders contain a PDF of the schematic and the EDA project created with [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) version 6.0.

A detailed discussion of the design is published [here](https://hackaday.io/project/183093-neopixel-punk-console).
